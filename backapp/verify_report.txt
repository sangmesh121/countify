✓ No anomalies detected

💭 DETAILED REASONING:
   A detailed forensic inspection was performed on the Parle-G
   biscuit packaging image with maximum sensitivity. **TEXT &
   TYPOGRAPHY:** - The primary brand name 'Parle-G' uses the correct
   script font; curves, thickness, and connections between letters
   are accurate. There are no spelling mistakes. Kerning appears
   consistent and professional. The edges of the yellow text against
   the red background are crisp and show no signs of blur or ink
   bleeding. - The 'EXPORT PACK' text is in the expected sans-serif,
   all-caps font. Spelling is correct, kerning is even, and text
   edges are sharp without any visible bleeding. - Smaller textual
   elements (like the green 'V' vegetarian mark) are clear, even if
   the surrounding micro-text is unreadable due to resolution
   limitations, its presence and shape are consistent with authentic
   packaging. There are no obvious font deviations or irregularities
   in any visible text. **COLOR & FINISH:** - The iconic red
   background color exhibits the correct saturation and vibrancy,
   consistent with the official Parle-G brand palette. It is neither
   too neon nor washed out. - The yellow used for the 'Parle-G' logo
   is bright and distinct, matching brand standards. - Other colors,
   such as the child's skin tone, hair, the white of the shirt and
   milk splash, and the golden-brown biscuits, appear natural and
   well-graded, indicating high-quality printing.
   **STRUCTURAL/PACKAGING:** - The top seal features a clean and
   regular pattern of red and white diagonal stripes, showing good
   alignment. While physical texture and seal quality cannot be
   fully assessed from a 2D image, the visual presentation suggests
   professional manufacturing without uneven cuts or low-quality
   material indication. **Graphics:** - The image of the child, the
   milk splash, and the biscuits are all sharp, well-defined, and
   free from pixelation or distortion. Conclusion: No anomalies were
   detected in any of the scrutinised features (text, typography,
   color, or graphics), indicating a visually authentic product
   based on the provided image.
