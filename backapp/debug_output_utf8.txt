Here's the analysis of the last letter and the brand name transcription:

1.  **Description of the shape of the last letter:**
    The last letter is a lowercase, stylized, cursive 'g'.
    *   **Does it curve up at the bottom like a hook?** Yes, the main descending stroke of the letter curves sharply to the left at the bottom, forming a distinct, elegant hook that sweeps upwards, rising above the baseline of the letter.
    *   **Does it have a horizontal bar pointing inward like a standard 'G'?** No, it does not have a distinct, straight horizontal bar pointing inward. Instead, the inner closure of the 'g' is formed by a small, curved stroke that originates from the inner right side of the main loop and curves slightly upward and left to meet the main body, completing the characteristic enclosed shape of a 'g' in this cursive style.
    *   **Is it a 'J' or a 'G'?** It is unequivocally a **'G'**. The presence of the enclosed upper loop, combined with the descending and upward-hooking tail, is the defining characteristic of a lowercase cursive 'g'. A 'J' would typically lack the internal closure and have a simpler, often symmetrical, upward curve at the bottom.

2.  **Transcription:**
    The brand name is **Parle-G**.
